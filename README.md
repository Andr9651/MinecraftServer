# Not a Product or Projekt 
This repository is just a Minecraft Server + Save data, with a small batch-script that makes it easy for my friends and I to play together.
It allows us to change server host without much hassle.

The batch script is pretty simple:
1. Pull the repository
2. Start the minecraft server
3. Wait for the server to close and save
4. Commit and Push the changes

Its very naive and does not include any safety checks
